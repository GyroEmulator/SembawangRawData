# SembawangRawData
Pertainent data to a gravitaitonal survey, performed in Sembawang, Singapore.

The absolute gravimeter readings are in the files with the naming convention FluorescentRatio_XYZ... : the timestamp is the beggining of the data capturing.
Each gravity measurement is a sequence of 100 points:
i) The timestep between each data point is 2.5s.
ii) Even numbered points are subject to -k polarization, odd numbered points to +k polarization. 
ii) The intial fringe frequency is f0 = 25.0706916 MHz, and increases by df=1.52Hz every 2 data points.

The relative gravity data is found in "CG
